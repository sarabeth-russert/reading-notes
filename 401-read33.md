Describe use cases for useMemo() and useReducer()
- useReducer is best used when you are dealing with a complex object where individual properties need to be operated on.
-  useMemo, will save a value to the cache, and will NOT run again during re-renders unless the value of data is changed. It allows you to save proccessing on things that will not change. [medium.com](https://medium.com/@binyamin/react-hooks-usereducer-usecallback-usememo-5e5af9b0257a)

Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
- A custom hook name should start with a prefix use, that will indicate the usage of hooks inside it [dev](https://dev.to/spukas/react-hooks-creating-custom-state-hook-300c)
- I am assumin based on this explanation that React knows that the use prefix indicates it is a hook and not a component, however I don't know if react uses this or if it is just for readability for programmers.

What do custom hooks usually do?
- they modularize state/hooks and functions 

Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
- useRequireAuth, a hook for oAuth looked very useful

Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
- it might be a full crud library that takes in a url and can handle all methods on that url.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

reducer
- An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. (If youâ€™re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.) useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
