>Silicon Valleyâ€™s gender gap is the result of computer-game marketing 20 years ago

- In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley were male
- In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced

Things haven't always been so skewed. By the early 80's over 30% of computer science grads were women but those numbers began dropping in the mid 80's and by 2016 the number was as low as 18%. This article theorizes that the male focused computer marketing campaigns in the 80's and 90's may be to blame.

Programming is a high paying and growing occupation. Women will not have the same access to tech roles. In some states not a single girl took an AP level computer science exam in 2014.

In the early 80's young boys became the target of computer marketing due to a recession. It was an attempt to hang on to the only market still buying games. It became a self feeding cycle. We can follow the result of this marketing strategy by seeing how men compared to women in the mid 90's in university placement exams for computer science.

Even when women are strong in coding and mathmatics the male-dominated enviroment can be hard for them to succeed in. If people in authority roles don't foster a welcoming environment towards women it contributes to a culture where most women won't stay.

This article says that until marketing around computers changes this trend will continue.
