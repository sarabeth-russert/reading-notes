## Code 401
#### Day 12


**Bearer Authorization**

Write the following steps in the correct order:
1. Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
2. Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
3. Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
4. Receive authorization code
5. Make a request to the access token endpoint
6. Receive access token
7. Make a request to a third-party API endpoint

What can you do with an authorization code?
- exchange it for an access token

What can you do with an access token?
- The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data. [oauth.com](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/)

What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication? 
- it is more secure as it is not transmitting actual user credentials, only a token which has time limitations and access limitations.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Client ID
- the clients id used to authenticate a user

Client Secret
- the secret that is attached to the signature at the end of an access token like jwt

Authentication Endpoint
- seems to be the url you use to authenticate something

Access Token Endpoint
- https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/ [oauth.com](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/)

API Endpoint
- Where the API information is stored

Authorization Code
- The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what the information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request [oauth.com](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/server-side-apps/authorization-code/)

Access Token
- something like a JWT that allows the browser to access content at a specified level fot a period of time without having to enter credentials again
