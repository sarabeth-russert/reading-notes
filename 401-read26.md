**Component Based UI**

Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
- Vue
- Angular
- Bootstrap
- Jquery
- Ionic

Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
- A framework is an environment where you can run your code, a library is a tool to help you write your application

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Rendering 
- Making something write to a page using the render() method which returns jsx

Templates
- I am not sure if this is asking for the difference between a templating language and react or if it is asking about react templates that you can download to create a project for you like create-react??

State
- state is a property on a component that defines data in that moment. It can be changed and using and 'setting' state causes the component to refresh and update.
