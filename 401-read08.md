## Code 401
#### Day 8


**Express Routing & Connected API**
Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
1. for verifying the parameter a user passes through a url
2. to add something to the req.body
3. to console.log information about the request to the developer

True or false: The route handler is middleware?
- true

In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
- by not including a next() function call at the end of the code block

At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
- after the route has been hit

What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”
- seems like this can happen when two reponses are attempted which could potentially be due to async issues or something similar

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Middleware
- Middleware in the context of distributed applications is software that provides services beyond those provided by the operating system to enable the various components of a distributed system to communicate and manage data. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware_(distributed_applications))

Request Object
- the object that contains all of the information contained on a request

Response Object
- the object that contains all of the information contained on a response

Application Middleware
- unsure what this is specifying... 

Routing Middleware
- in an express server routing middleware is software that runs between the route being hit and the function that responds to the route being hit. It can long information or add something to the request body, along with other useful applications.
