**Routing**
Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?
- Yes. Through properties passed down via props.

When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?
- I think this is refering to HOC, I am not sure exactly what this question is asking but the reading had this to say: Note that a HOC doesn’t modify the input component, nor does it use inheritance to copy its behavior. Rather, a HOC composes the original component by wrapping it in a container component. A HOC is a pure function with zero side-effects.

And that’s it! The wrapped component receives all the props of the container, along with a new prop, data, which it uses to render its output. The HOC isn’t concerned with how or why the data is used, and the wrapped component isn’t concerned with where the data came from.

Can a component, such as <Content />, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?
- Yes

What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children
- using the spread opperator

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

props.children
- the 'children' key of the property object refers to information nested between an opening and closing bracket of the component on the parent component.

composition
- In React, composition is a natural pattern of the component model. It's how we build components from other components, of varying complexity and specialization through props. Depending on how generalized these components are, they can be used in building many other components. [dev](https://dev.to/bouhm/thinking-in-react-component-composition-fp5)
