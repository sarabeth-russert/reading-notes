**Authentication**

Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms)
- In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)

Explain how the Singleton pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes
- You can use it to instantiate only one instance of the class and assign that with a const so it cannot be changed. You can also use .freeze to ensure the object cannot be changed.[sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/bundle-static-site-webpack/)

If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?
- gosh I don't know, try to make a list of things that my app would need to help it more user friendly and convenient and write functions for those things?

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Router Middleware
- Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging. [expressJs.com](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)

Dynamic Module Loading
- Dynamic import() introduces a new function-like form of import that caters to those use cases. import(moduleSpecifier) returns a promise for the module namespace object of the requested module, which is created after fetching, instantiating, and evaluating all of the module’s dependencies, as well as the module itself. [v8.dev](https://v8.dev/features/dynamic-import)

Singleton Pattern
- the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one "single" instance. (see above)

CRUD -> REST Method Matches
- create -> post
- read -> get
- update -> put/patch
- delete -> delete

Mock Testing
- Mock testing is an approach to unit testing that lets you make assertions about how the code under test is interacting with other system modules. In mock testing, the dependencies are replaced with objects that simulate the behaviour of the real ones. [developedia](https://devopedia.org/mock-testing)
