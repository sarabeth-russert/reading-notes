## Code 401
#### Day 18

**Socket.io**
What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
- because small pieces of data can be sent efficiently from sender to reciever. Once recieved they and be reassembled into a larger piece of data

UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
- Because it is not necessary to create a connection prior to data being sent

Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
- yes, a socket server can have multiple connections from clients

Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
- a client socket can only connect to one server, but if the application has multiple sockets it could connect to multiple servers

Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
- yes if they are on different ports

TCP
- TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. Connection-orientation means that the communicating devices should establish a connection before transmitting data and should close the connection after transmitting the data. [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/)
UDP
- UDP is the Datagram oriented protocol. This is because there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, and terminating a connection. UDP is efficient for broadcast and multicast type of network transmission. [geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/)
Packets
- packets carry the data in the protocols that the Internet uses: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Each packet contains part of the body of your message [how stuff works](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/question525.htm)

Socket
- Definition: A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.
