## Code 401
#### Day 19

**Message Queues**
What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
- That data can be sent both directions from client to server and vice versa

Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
- Yes it does... The best I can understand is that socket.io is not a websocket server, it is a "bidirectional event-based communication library" (from their website), which sometimes chooses websockets as the transport. Http might be necesssary for other types of transports.

What happens when a client emits an event?
- the event is sent to the server and the server decides how to handle it

What happens when a server emits an event?
- The server specifies who will recieve the message and then sends it to the applicable clients

What happens if a client “misses” an event?
- I couldn't find info on this but I am assuming that it will be gone.

How can we mitigate this?
- ??

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Web Socket
-  The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client
   running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host
   that has opted-in to communications from that code.  The security
   model used for this is the origin-based security model commonly used
   by web browsers.  The protocol consists of an opening handshake
   followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP.  The goal of
   this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based
   applications that need two-way communication with servers that does
   not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)

Socket.io
- an npm library for connecting to and managing tcp socket/connections

Client
- one end of the client/server socket connection. Connects to the servers port to send and recieves messages. Sends messages only to the server.

Server
- the other end of the client/server socket connection. Creates a connection that clients can connect to, can send/recieve messages to any connected client.
