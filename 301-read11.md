**EJS and Google Books API**

EJS or Embeded Javascript is a templating language for embedding javascript directly into an html markup file with the extension .ejs

- use `<%` 'stuff' `%>` to insert stuff into a document. 
- can be used to perform standard javascript processes like loops and logic statements

To use
- npm i ejs
- `const path = require('path');`
- `app.set('views', path.join(__dirname), 'views'));`
- `app.set('view engine', 'ejs');`
- create a new folder called views, and create a doc with an ejs extension
> `app.get('route', function(request, response) {`

> `response.render('filename');`

>`});`
