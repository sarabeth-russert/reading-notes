**The Growth Mindset**

We define *mindset* as self-perception or self-thery that people hold about themselves. The idea of a *growth mindset* is the belief that basic ability (talent and intelligence) can be developed through dedication and hardwork. In oposition a *fixed mindset* holds that our intelligence and talent are fixed traits and you are doomed to stay exactly where you currently are for the rest of your life. 
We have all probably witnessed this *fixed mindset* to be untrue in our own lives, as we have grown in fitness, improved at a skill, or learned a new talent many times throughout our lives already. We can prepare our brains for learning more rapidly by embracing the concepts of *growth mindset*.
1. Embrace Challenges
- Rather than avoiding a challenge embrace the idea that things may be difficult at first but we learn most when challenged.
2. Persist when faced with Obstacles
- Get help when needed and don't give up!
3. Look at Effort as a necessary part of growth and learning
- It's supposed to be hard, if it was easy we would most likely already know it.
4. Learn from Criticism
- Try not to dismiss or ignore feedback and criticism, it will help you to evaluate your work and improve.
5. Be inspired by the Success of Others
- Do not view others as a threat. Either try to lift them up or allow their work to elevate you!

I am super excited to keep the Growth Mindset as a focus in my future. I love to learn and there is so much to learn that anything that helps it go faster is awesome!
