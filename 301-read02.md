**JS Ch 7 - JQuery**

> "Write less, do More"

JQuery allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code then you would need to use with plain Javascript. It offers a simple way to achieve a variety of tasks quickly and consistently across all major browsers.

JQ is a is a Javascript file you can include in your web page the same way you would a regular JS file via the `<script>` tag. 

It works the same way as a DOM query but with a more simple syntax. There are many built in methods that allow you to affect the DOM.

JQ creates and object for each selector used. If the selection returns one or more element the object will be array like with each element returned being indexed starting with zero. 

Some methods can both get and set information. If you are getting information the default is to only get information from the element at the index of zero in the object. The first instance of the element returned. If you are setting information it will set *every* element within the object. *Implicit Iteration* is the ability to update all of the elements in a query selection at one time. When setting information you can also chain methods using dot notation.

JQ creates references to locations on the DOM. When you store a query in a variable you are storing the reference to the location. You should always store a query in a variable if you are accessing the location more than once, it is more efficient.

To get information
- `.html()` gets everything from within the element, even the html code
- `.text()` only returns the text, no code

To update
- `.html()`
- `.text()`
- `.replaceWith()`
- `.remove()`

Insert elements
- `.before()`
- `.after()`
- `.prepend()`
- `.append()`

Effect attributes
- `.attr()`
- `.removeAttr()`
- `.addClass()`
- `.removeClass()`

`.css()` allows you to get and set css properties

`.each()` allows you to loop through multiple elements in a selection. Contextual "this" can be used on the object.

`.on()` is used to handle events. It takes an event and a handler function. The handler function recieves an event object which has methods and properties- like type, which, target, etc.

There are also a bunch of cool animation effects that can be used in JQuery.

You can attempt to use an already loaded version of JQ from a cdn when you are linking it to your page. As a backup place a second script with a conditional to be used if a previous version does not exist.

There are three methods to add JQuery to your document, `.load()`, `.ready()`, and placing the script at the end of your page. I am not really sure which is prefered or really even what this means because I was assuming that putting it at the bottom of your body element would be the default way to include it and nothing else would need to be done?

**Article Notes: 6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

*Pair Programming* is when two developers work together with one acting as the *driver* and one as the *navigator* to complete a project. Benefits are:
1. Greater efficiency due to less mistakes
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from your fellow student
4. Building social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
