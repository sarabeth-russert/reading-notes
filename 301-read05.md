## Code 301
#### Day 4

**Heroku**

How to deploy on heroku

- $`heroku login`

while in a git repo on terminal

- $`heroku create`
- $`git push heroku main`
- $`heroku ps:scale web=1`
- $`heroku open`

**View logs**
Heroku treats logs as streams of time-ordered events aggregated from the output streams of all your app and Heroku components, providing a single channel for all of the events.

View information about your running app using one of the logging commands 
- $`heroku logs --tail:`

control + c to close logs

**Define a Procfile**
Use a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile), a text file in the root directory of your application, to explicitly declare what command should be executed to start your app.

The Procfile in the example app you deployed looks like this:

web: node index.js

This declares a single process type, web, and the command needed to run it. The name web is important here. It declares that this process type will be attached to the HTTP routing stack of Heroku, and receive web traffic when deployed.

Procfiles can contain additional process types. For example, you might declare one for a background worker process that processes items off of a queue.

**Dyno**
Think of a dyno as a lightweight container that runs the command specified in the Procfile.

You can check how many dynos are running using the ps command:

- $`heroku ps`
- $`heroku ps:scale web=0`
- $`heroku ps:scale web=1`

**Running Locally**
Heroku recognizes an app as Node.js by the existence of a package.json file in the root directory. For your own apps, you can create one by running 
- $`npm init --yes`

The package.json file determines both the version of Node.js that will be used to run your application on Heroku, as well as the dependencies that should be installed with your application.

Run this command in your local directory to install the dependencies, preparing your system for running the app locally:

- $`npm install`

Once dependencies are installed, you will be ready to run your app locally. Youâ€™ll notice that a package-lock.json file is generated when npm install is run. Make sure to check this into git. When subsequent dependencies are added, npm will make changes to this file, so be sure to add those changes to git too.

When an app is deployed, Heroku reads the package.json to install the appropriate node version and the package-lock.json to install the dependencies.

Now start your application locally using the heroku local command, which was installed as part of the Heroku CLI:

- $`heroku local web`

Open http://localhost:5000 with your web browser. You should see your app running locally.

To stop the app from running locally, in the CLI, press Ctrl+C to exit.

**ACP for Heroku**
- $`git add .`
- $`git commit -m " "`
- $`git push heroku main`

Finally, check that everything is working:

- $`heroku open`

**Start a console**
To get a real feel for how dynos work, you can create another one-off dyno and run the bash command, which opens up a shell on that dyno. You can then execute commands there. Each dyno has its own ephemeral filespace, populated with your app and its dependencies - once the command completes (in this case, bash), the dyno is removed.

- $`heroku run bash`

`~ $ ls`

`~ $ exit`
