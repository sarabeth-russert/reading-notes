**Shay Howe's Intro to RWD**

Reactive Web Design, a term coined by Ethan Marcote, is the practice of building a web site to work on every screen size and has become the answer to serving the surging growth of mobile internet use. 
- Reactive and adaptive designs are made to to fit multiple screen sizes
- Mobile design is a seperate design specific to mobile devices

Flexible Layout: the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid capable of dynamicaly resizing to any width.
- when sizing flexible elements for a grid find the percentage of space the should occupy in their parent container

Media Queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browsers and devices. 
- the media feature and value return a boolean response to determine if styles will be applied
- media features identify what attributes or properties woll be targeted within the media query expression

Mobile-first is a technique that styles for a mobile device then uses queries to add styling as the viewport size increases.

Viewport height, width, and scale should be put in css for mobile first design
- `@viewport { width:device-width; zoom:1;}`

To make media flexible set it at max-width 100% of parent container

**All About Floats**

Float is a CSS positioning property. Floated elements remain a part of the flow of a web page. Absolutely positioned elements are removed from the flow, allowing text to sit on top of them. 
- Float has 4 values
  - left
  - right
  - none
  - clear

Seems like overall you shouldn't use float for the whole layout of a page but it's great for smaller sections.
