Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department. I thought of my 301 group project which was a movie selector and how we stored data for the movie
1. keyword - a collection of movies that had the keyword halloween
2. movie - a single movie that was one of the collection
3. review - the reviews on that movie

What is the advantage of an ORM, like Mongoose?
- They write correct and optimized SQL queries, thereby eliminating the hassle for developers. They make the code easier to update, maintain, and reuse as the developer can think of, and manipulate data as objects. [yellowant](https://blog.yellowant.com/orm-rethinking-data-as-objects-8ddaa43b1410)

How does the repository pattern compare with an ORM?
- Repositories deal with Domain/Business objects (from the app point of view), an ORM handles db objects. A business objects IS NOT a db object, first has behaviour, the second is a glorified DTO, it only holds data [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10155517/repository-pattern-vs-orm#:~:text=Repositories%20deal%20with%20Domain%2FBusiness,DTO%2C%20it%20only%20holds%20data.)

When making a repository/facade, what flexibility do you gain?
- Makes it easier to manipulate data when wanting to change your storage.

Name 3 cloud based NoSQL Databases
1. mongoDB
2. couchBase
3. Redis

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

lifecycle
- The Database Life Cycle (DBLC) contains six phases: database initial study, database design, implementation and loading, testing and evaluation, operation, and maintenance and evolution. [my reading room](http://www.myreadingroom.co.in/notes-and-studymaterial/65-dbms/506-database-development-life-cycle.html)

collections
- where mongoDB stores documents, similar to a table in SQL

the “Repository” design pattern
- To put it simply, Repository pattern is a kind of container where data access logic is stored. It hides the details of data access logic from business logic. In other words, we allow business logic to access the data object without having knowledge of underlying data access architecture. [cubettech](https://cubettech.com/resources/blog/introduction-to-repository-design-pattern/)

mongoose middleware
- Middleware (also called pre and post hooks) are functions which are passed control during execution of asynchronous functions. Middleware is specified on the schema level and is useful for writing plugins. Mongoose has 4 types of middleware: document middleware, model middleware, aggregate middleware, and query middleware. [mongoosejs.com](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html)

Object Relation Mapping (ORM)
- Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping)
