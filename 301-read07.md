[What Google learned from it's quest to build the perfect team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

With the increasing amount of time workers are spending in group collaboration google set out to find out why some teams work really well together and others are unsuccessful. The put together a research team called Project Aristotle to study and analyze group dynamics and productivity to try to discover a pattern. They could not figure out for a long time what the pattern was- there were goups made up of very similar assortments of people with wildly different productivity rates and this led them to discover that the group make-up was not what determined success.
Instead what was determined to be the leading cause of success for a group was the emotional intelligence and phycological safety that was part of that groups culture. Things like equal time talking per group member, listening to each other, and being aware of each others feelings seemed to be the most important factors in a group working together and raising the groups collective IQ. Being able to feel safe in throwing out new ideas or personal opinions makes people more willing to take risks and be more innovative.

Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers that sents documents across the internet. He helped write HTTP, the hypertext transfer protocol, that tells the browser what protocol to use, and can describe the location of information anywhere in the world.

The Web is built on an architectual style called REST. REST provides a definition of a resource which is what the URL directs us to. A web page is a representation of a concept the browser creates from the resource. API is a different type of resource. 

Using verbs like GET, PUT, POST, DELETE lets machines do something to nouns on other machines via http.
