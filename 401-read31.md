**Hooks API**
Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
- We use internal routing on out component that is rendered into the 'root' element in our index.html page.

If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
- Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />`, we put it outside the switch so that it won't be part of the conditions that change with routing.

What does props.children contain?
- Anything that was inserted between the opening and closing tag of the component.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms
Composition
- In React, composition is a natural pattern of the component model. It's how we build components from other components, of varying complexity and specialization through props. Depending on how generalized these components are, they can be used in building many other components. [dev](https://dev.to/bouhm/thinking-in-react-component-composition-fp5)

Children / Child Components
- something nested inside another thing

Hash Routing
- A `<Router>` that uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.

Link Routing
- a `<Router>` that uses a declarative, accessible navigation around your application.
