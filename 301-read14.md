**Database Normalization**

[Article](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-database-normalization-explained-in-simple-english/)

>Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.

Choose a single focus for each table. It should only cover one topic and the supporting topics.

Three reasons to normalize a database
1. minimize duplicate data
2. minimize or avoid data modification issues
3. simplify queries

Modification Anomalies that can occur
- Insert Anomaly, we are gated from inserting new data because we are not adding another piece of data integral to creating a new entry (like a primary key)
- Update Anomaly, having the same information repeated in many places on a table makes updates tedious
- Deletion Anomaly, deleting a row may cause the deletion of other data we need, even though we don't need the primary key

Forms of database normalization (progressive)
1. First Normal Form - The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
2. Second Normal Form – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
3. Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
