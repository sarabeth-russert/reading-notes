Given the examples of front-end events such as button click, window resize, form submit, etc, what are some examples of back-end events?
- They can be whatever you want them to be, but connect is a very common one I have seen used.

Why are events sometimes better than asynchronous actions with callbacks?
- EventEmitter object emits an event, all of the functions attached to that specific event are called synchronously, causing the things attached to them to happen in order.

What does an EventEmitter instance do?
- allows us to create events and listeners

When is a programâ€™s call stack, event queue, and event loop active?
- when the first function is invoked the process begins and the async stack begins collecting and running functions to pass to the event loop. Whenever the call stack is clear the event loop is able to add functions that are waiting to be run. When the event loop, async stack, and call stack are clear it becomes inactive.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Observer Pattern
- The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)

Listener
- a function that listens for an event and then calls a handler function to act on the event

Event Handler
- a call back function that acts when an event occurs

Event Driven Programming
- When an app is designed around the occurance of events and the results that has

Event Loop
- the queue that passes processed async functions back into the callstack

Event Queue
- a list of event handlers in the order they occured

Call Stack
- a stack that handles the running of all functions

Emit/Raise/Trigger
- emit triggers an event listener by saying "hey an event is occuring"

Subscribe
- part of the publish/subscribe pattern in the Observer Pattern

database
- a way to organize and store data
