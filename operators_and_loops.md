#### Day 4

**Operators and Loops**

**Operators**
Comparison Operators evaluate conditions 
- == equal to
- != not equal to
- === strict equals
- `>` greater than
- `<` less than
- `>=` greater or equal to
- `<=` less or equal to

Logical Operators allow you to compare the results of one or more comparison operators
- && logical and
- || logical or
- ! logical not

*operands* surround the operator

*Short Circuit Evaluation* once one part makes the statement proves validity the evaluation stops.

**Loops**

Loops check a statement to see if a condition is true. If it is true, something happens, and the condition is checked again. This repeats until the condition is no longer true.

For Loops run a specific number of times at which the condition becomes false. Where `i` is the variable assigned to the counter and the count stops at `< 10` since JS is a zero indexed language count generally starts at 0.

> `for (let i = 0; 0 < 10; i++)`

While Loops have no set count but also evaluate a condition for truth, the condition can change due to user input, environmental change, or you can put a counter on it.

> `while (i > 10) {do something;}`
