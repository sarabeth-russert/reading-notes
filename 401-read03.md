In your reading notes page for this class, provide answers to the following prompts. Cite any external sources

Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
1. Identify errors quickly
2. Plan your code before you write it
3. Find and code for edge cases

In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- to perform an action before or after each test. Can be to reset a count on a spy.

What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- takes a lot of time upfront

Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
- syntax, under the hood they are the same

Name a use case for a static method
- a static method is defined in a Class but is not attached the the object 'this'

Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves
- a higher order function is one who's return value is another function

**Document the following Vocabulary Terms**

functional programming
- the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. [medium](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0)

pure function
- A pure function is a function which:
  - Given the same inputs, always returns the same output, and
  - Has no side-effects [medium](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0)

higher-order function
- A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function [medium](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/higher-order-functions-composing-software-5365cf2cbe99)

immutable state
- one that can't be changed once it is created

object
- a collection of properties

object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. [techtarget](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP)

class
- a class describes the contents of the objects that belong to it

prototype
- Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes)

super
- The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super)

inheritance
- recieving the properties and functions associated with a parent object

constructor
- a function used to create an object with a specific shape

instance
- a new object created following the shape defined by a constructor

context
- context refers to the object that a function is refering to at any point

this
- this is the object in context

Test Driven Development (TDD)
- the process of starting development with a failing test and writing code to make it pass

Jest
- library for running tests

Continuous Integration (CI)
- In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)

unit test
- Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
