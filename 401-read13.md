## Code 401
#### Day 13


**OAuth**

Why is authentication important?
- to make sure we protect user resources

Why should we be careful about storing a userâ€™s password?
- because it leaves their credentials vulnerable, which not only compromises their account on your app but potentially others if they are not using different passwords for every site

What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
- Hashing uses an algorthm to scramble a users credentials which can not be undone. Encryption is a process of scrambling users credentials that can be undone.

What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
- encoding is used to make data more managable, encryption is used to make data more secure

What is a token used for?
- to show that the users credentials have been verified

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

authentication
- verifies credentials

authorization
- Gives access

encryption
- the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access - dictionary definition

hashing
- using an algorthm to scramble data that can not be reversed

session
- In computer science and networking in particular, a session is a temporary and interactive information interchange between two or more communicating devices, or between a computer and user [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_)

cookie

- Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication)

encoding
- convert into a coded form- in CS to make data shorter or more managable

secret
- a private piece of information that can be attached to a signature to prove authenticity of a token

cryptography
- the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)
