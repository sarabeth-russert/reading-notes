## Code 401
#### Day 1

**Node Ecosystem, TDD, CI/CD**

Describe (in plain English) what Array.map() does:

array.map returns a new array from an original array where each original element is affected by the instructions in the code block and then pushed in to the new array.

Describe (in plain English) what Array.reduce() does:

array.reduce is an array method that takes in an array and evaluates each element, .reduce has a special value called an "accumulator" that is effected each time the next element is evaluated. The return value of .reduce is the end value of the Accumulator. It can be used to count, add values, and do many other things.

Provide code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result

To use superagent:

`superagent.get(url)`

 `.then(results => console.log('do something with the ' + results)`

or

`async function superAgentCall() {`

  `let promise = await superagent.get(url);`

  `console.log('The results of the call are ' + promise)`

`}`

Callback functions are asyncronous when used as callback arguments in another function because they are passed to a second stack that puts them in queue in the event loop so they opperate outside of the regular flow of code.

[additional information about node.js](301-read06.md)


Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
1. module exports
2. how the v-8 engine works
3. require()

Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
1. Creating and sharing libraries for npm
2. When to use setTimeOut in practice
3. posting with superagent

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
- I am excited to learn more about what is offered in npm, I feel like there are probably so many amazing libraries that would be fun and useful to use.
