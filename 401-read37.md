**Redux - Combined Reducers**

Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
- A quick google search shows tons of people giving reasons why NOT to use redux over global state. The common arguments seem to be that redux is complex and has a steep learning curve, that redux requires more libraries, and that you can't manipulate the state in the component. The reasons *to choose redux* seem harder to find. My impression is that redux allows you to access global state from any component. It has action and reducer functions that can affect change to state and pass that change down to a component. I am hoping to learn and understand more about redux as I continue to use it this week.

What is the purpose of a reducer?
- reducer takes and action and affects change to state or due to state, then passes it down to a component

What does an action contain?
- action contains a type and a payload

Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
- so that the original state is not mutated by the reducer 

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

immutable state
- state that does not change

time travel in redux
- Time travel is the ability to move back and forth among the previous states of an application and view the results in real time. With Redux, given a specific state and a specific action, the next state of the application is always exactly the same. Redux is a predictable state container and it easy to implement time travel with it. Most often done with the redux devtools extension [scottlogic.com](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2017/03/09/relogic-2.html)

action creator
- An action creator is merely a function that returns an action object.
- Redux includes a utility function called bindActionCreators for binding one or more action creators to the store's dispatch() function.
- Calling an action creator does nothing but return an object, so you have to either bind it to the store beforehand, or dispatch the result of calling your action creator. [read.reduxbook.com](https://read.reduxbook.com/markdown/part1/04-action-creators.html)

reducer
- A reducer is a function that determines changes to an application’s state. It uses the action it receives to determine this change. We have tools, like Redux, that help manage an application’s state changes in a single store so that they behave consistently.

dispatch
- dispatch is a function of the Redux store. You call store.dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change. [react-redux.js.org](https://react-redux.js.org/using-react-redux/connect-mapdispatch)
