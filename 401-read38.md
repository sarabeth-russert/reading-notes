**Redux - Asynchronous Actions**

How granular should your reducers be?
- It seems like the best choice is somewhere in the middle, you don't need to go crazy and sepperate everything if it is not necessary. As long as logically you don't have conflicts.

Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
- I think this depends on if it is intentional or not. You don't want random side effects in your code that can cause unexpected results or errors. I think best to keep it sepperate and then intentionally trigger a second reducer if you need it.

Name a strategy for preventing the above
- have different actions for each reducer

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

store
- in redux it holds all the global state for your application

combined reducers
- adding additional reducers in the form of a reducer object so that you can have more than one reducer for your store
