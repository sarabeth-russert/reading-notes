What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
- Pros: The cookie is not accessible via JavaScript; hence, it is not as vulnerable to XSS attacks as localStorage.

If you're using httpOnly and secure cookies, that means your cookies cannot be accessed using JavaScript. This means, even if an attacker can run JS on your site, they can't read your access token from the cookie.
It's automatically sent in every HTTP request to your server.
Cons: Depending on the use case, you might not be able to store your tokens in the cookies.

Cookies have a size limit of 4KB. Therefore, if you're using a big JWT Token, storing in the cookie is not an option.
There are scenarios where you can't share cookies with your API server or the API requires you to put the access token in the Authorization header. In this case, you won't be able to use cookies to store your tokens. [dev](https://dev.to/cotter/localstorage-vs-cookies-all-you-need-to-know-about-storing-jwt-tokens-securely-in-the-front-end-15id)

Explain 3rd party cookies.
- Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a "Like" button on your website which will store a cookie on visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitor and see which websites he visited.

How do pixel tags work?
- A tracking pixel is an HTML code snippet which is loaded when a user visits a website or opens an email. It is useful for tracking user behavior and conversions. With a tracking pixel, advertisers can acquire data for online marketing, web analysis or email marketing. A tracking pixel (also called 1x1 pixel or pixel tag) is a graphic with dimensions of 1x1 pixels that is loaded when a user visits a webpage or opens an email. Because it is so small, it can hardly be seen by visitors of a website or email recipients. These tracking pixels are partly or fully designed to be transparent, or camouflaged in the background color of the website so that they don't stand out to users. Users are usually not supposed to see the tracking pixel. This was a really good reference![RYTE WIKI](https://en.ryte.com/wiki/Tracking_Pixel)

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

cookies
- An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie, or simply cookie) is a small piece of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember stateful information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, logging in, or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card numbers.[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie)

authorization
- permision granted for a user or admin to access a route or data

access control
- a system used to determine who is authorized to access specific routes and data

conditional rendering
- In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application. [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
