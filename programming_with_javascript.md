## Code 102
#### Day 4

**Programming with Javascript**

Javascript makes web pages more interactive
- access content
- modify content
- program rules into your page (like a series of steps)
- react to events (like a button click)

Can make lots of content more dynamic
- slideshows
- forms
- reload only portions of the page to update
- filter data

*Script* A series of instructions. Comparable to recipes, handbooks, and manuals. A browser may use different parts of the script depending on the users interaction with the page. Can run different sections of code in response to conditions. When writing a script think like a computer with every step written out
- define the goal
- design the script (split it into steps)
- code each step

*Expressions* evalute into a single value. Some assign a value to a variable, and some perform an opperation to result in a sinlge value.

*Operators* allow programers to create a single value from one or more values using 
- assignment
- arithmetic
- string
- comparison
- logical (and/or)

*Arithmetic* follows pedmas + - / * ++ -- %

*Strings* concatenation, if uou try to use arithmetic operators on strings the retun is NaN

*Function* lets you group a series of instructions together to perform a specific task. "Calling" a function refers to asking it to run it's series of instructions. Some functions require *parameters* refered to as *arguments*. *return value* refers to any information a function passes out. To use the return value, assign your function call to a variable.

> Declare a Function 

> `function functionName(parameters) {block of code;}`

>Call a Function

>`functionName(argument);`
