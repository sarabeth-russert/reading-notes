**Templating with Mustache**

Javascript templating is a way of using code in your html that places variables for you to fill in later in your javascript.

Mustache is a template syntax you can use to format data to be compiled by a template engine.

**A Guide to Flexbox**

Flexbox is a very awesome display formatting module for css. It is a very versatile alternative to float. 

Flexbox has properties specific to the parent/container selector and properties specific to the child/flex items.

You can alter the display order, display direction, grow or shrink the space an element takes up. Wrap and flow content, and change spacing and alignment of elements.

I have really enjoyed using it in my css!
