## Code 102
#### Day 1

**The Coders Computer**
Today we did all the installations required to begin our 102 course. One of the programs we installed is an **IDE** or *Integrated Development Environment* called [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The reading explained the difference between a standard text editor and an IDE. An IDE provides text editing, file management, compiling, and debugging all in one place... a text editor just allows you to edit text. 

Some of the other features provided by an IDE are:
- Syntax Highlighting
- Code Completion
- Color Themes 
- Extensions
- Debugging assistance

I have used VSCode in the past and am happy with how it functions. It would be cool to try using some of the other IDE's in the future to see how they may differ.
