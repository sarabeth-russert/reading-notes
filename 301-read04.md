**CSS Grid Garden**

We played a cute game today to learn about css grid.

[grid garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/)

Some of the things I learned about grid were
- `grid-column-start:` which vertical grid line the element starts at
- `grid-column-end:` which vertical grid line the element ends at
- `grid-row-start:` which horizontal grid line the element starts at
- `grid-row-end:` which horizontal grid line the element ends at
- `grid-area:` short-hand combining grid-row and grid-column properties
- `span` rows and columns with grid: you can use span to indicate how many spaces from your start or end point an element takes up
- `order:` overrides source code to reorder an element in 
- `grid-template-columns:` determines the size value of each column
- `grid-template-rows:` determines the size value of each row
- `fr` can be used in grid templates to indicate a portion/fraction of any area not yet defined

Seems like it will be very helpful to use grid when doing wireframes!
