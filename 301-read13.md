[Sending form data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data)

An HTML form on a web page is an easy way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.

*On the client side* 

The `<form>` defines how the data is sent. All of the attributes let you configure the request which will be sent when a user submits the form. Action and Method are the two most important.
- Action defines where the data gets sent... must be a valid relative or absolute url
- Method controls how it is sent. Most common being GET and POST.
  - GET will put the keys and values in the search bar by appending the url
  - Post will return data in the request.body

*On the server side*

The server will receive a string that will be parsed to get the data as a list of key : value pairs.

>Be paranoid: Never trust your users

>So, how do you fight these threats? This is a topic far beyond this guide, but there are a few rules to keep in mind. The most important rule is: never ever trust your users, including yourself; even a trusted user could have been hijacked.

>All data that comes to your server must be checked and sanitized. Always. No exception.

- Escape potentially dangerous characters. The specific characters you should be cautious with vary depending on the context in which the data is used and the server platform you employ, but all server-side languages have functions for this. Things to watch out for are character sequences that look like executable code (such as JavaScript or SQL commands).
- Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary.
- Sandbox uploaded files. Store them on a different server and allow access to the file only through a different subdomain or even better through a completely different domain.
