**Component Composition**
Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
- I think information only flows down. The only way I think a parent could access the state of a child component is if you pass it as a variable to a function going to the parent. A callback function, etc.

What can be passed along in a prop variable?
- anything you want to pass. State, text, etc

How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
- through props

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

component props
- the properties passed through from the parent class

component state
- state properties 'this' component saves to itself. These can be passed down to child components via state.

application state
- In an application, state is the interface between your data from any kind of backend or local change and the representation of this data with UI-elements in the frontend. State is able to keep the data of different components in sync because each state update will rerender all relevant components [medium](https://medium.com/dailyjs/comparison-of-state-management-solutions-for-react-2161a0b4af7b)
