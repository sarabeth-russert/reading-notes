**Props and State**

Does a deployed React application require a server?
- yes, a server or some hosting environment

Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
- To see how react affects the users view rather than the behavior of each individual function is react components display to a browser

What does npm run build do?
- in react it transpiles your code and optimizes it for production

Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
- I am not sure what this is asking me to describe. A react application has a front end structural entry point (an html file) that has an id/ mounting point that a jsx app file can mount to. The app file generally houses the app class component that acts as a parent to all of the other components for the page. There are also style sheets for individual components and for the html page itself. Once you run build, a build folder is created that houses the transpiled production files for deployment.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

BDD
- Behavior Driven Development

Acceptance Tests
- In engineering and its various subdisciplines, acceptance testing is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a specification or contract are met. ... Acceptance criteria are the criteria that a system or component must satisfy in order to be accepted by a user, customer, or other authorized entity.[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing)

mounting
- When a component is rendered and built to the dom

build
- when you run build in react your code is transpiled with babel and optimized for production by webpack so that it can be deployed.
