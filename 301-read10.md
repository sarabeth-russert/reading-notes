**THE CALL STACK**

(from the mdn docs) A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

(from free code camp) In summary the key takeaways from the call stack are:
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO — Last In, First Out data structure.

Errors and debugging
- Reference errors: when you try to use a variable that isn't defined yet
- Syntax errors: easy to fix if you can find your error
- Range errors: trying to use an invalid length with an object something that has a length
- Type errors: using a method that doesn't exist for a certain data type or otherwise trying to use a datatype incorrectly

Debugging
- use lots of console.log commands in key areas to determine where your issue is occuring. 
- using debugger to stop code
- evaluate the callstack in the console tool to find out which function was on the top of the stack when the issue occured
- use try and catch to handle errors

Use tools like Linters to help find errors before you run the code.
