**Computer Architecture and Logic**

***What makes a computer a computer?***

A computer is a thinking machine and every computer does 4 things
- takes input
- stores information
- processes information
- outputs results

The first computers were made from wood and metal. Later electrical compontents we added... they were very large and slow. Initially we just used computers as caculators but now they do so much more.

**Input** is given through a keyboard, mouse, touchpad, via voice, nav systems, camera, even vibration. Input is converted to bianary code and passed into the computer.

**Storage and Processing** occurs when the bianary code enters the computer and the CPU requests information from memory on how to process it. The result is then stored back in memory.

**Output** results when bianary code is passed from storage to the output device and converted for display or some way we can recieve it.

***Data and Bianary***

Although almost no one interacts with bianary code anymore our computers run exclusively on 1's and 0's. 

**Bianary Code** is created by wires sending or not sending an electrical signal. Resulting in a(n) on/true/1 return or a(n) off/false/0 return.

**Bit** is the smallest piece of information a computer can store and is is the on or off signal from a wire. More wires make more bits and with more bits more complex information can be represented. 8 wires can store numbers from 0 - 255. 32 wires can store 0 - 4 billion!!!

**The Bianary Number System** is constructed of place values that double in number for every place starting with the number one. For example in this bianary number "1011" the left number 1 is in the place with a value of 8, followed l to r by 0 in the place with the value 4, 1 in the place with the value 2, and 1 in the place with the value 1. The resulting number is 8+2+1=11. So cool!

Text, images, and sound can all be represented by bianary numbers.

***Circuits and Logic***

Circuits can modify and process information that is represented by 1's and 0's. There are lots of types of circuits and complicated circuits can take multiple signals and combine them to give different results
- "Not" circuits are very simple and take one signal flipping to the opposite of the given circut
- "And" circuits take two signals and returns true only if both signals are true
- "Adder" circuits take two bits and combine them outputting the sum. Multiple adders can be combined to produce large numbers

Smaller computers are so fast because the smaller a circuit is the less time it takes for electrical signals to travel.

***Memory, CPU, Input, and Output***

covered above, information merged into *What makes a computer a computer?*

***Hardware and Software***

- Hardware - the physical elements that make up a computer
- Software - the non-physical, programs and code that make the hardware work

**CPU** is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. There are circuits that all do specific jobs like sending information, or doing addition. The CPU recieves simple commands via bianary code that tell it which circuit to use. 

**Opperating System** or OS is the master program that manages how the software uses the hardware of a computer. It is the boss of all the other software.
