**FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING and Refactoring**

[Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

>Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

Focusing on the practice of pure and immutable functions...
- pure funcitons take all necessary variable information as parameters
- if a function reads external files it is not pure
- if a function relies on rng it is not pure
- it should not cause any observable side effects, mutability is discouraged (altering global vars)

Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable which makes them easier to test.

Immutability
- instead of changing items in your functions create new ones

Referencial Transparency
- if a function consistently yeilds the same result for the same input it is referentially transparent

Functions as first class entities
- functions treated as values and used as data

Higher order functions
- take one or more functions as arguments or
- return a function as a result
- .filter() .map() .reduce() are all higher order

Strategies for easier to read code
- return early from functions
- cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
- check for web api's before implementing your own functionality

Many of the suggestions in todays reading are out of the scope of my ability to put in to practice at this point but there are a few I can work on, and the rest I can tackle as I get further in my learning.
