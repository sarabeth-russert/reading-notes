Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
- They are two different file structuring patterns that you can use to manage your redux. Ducks puts every reducer in a module with its action and action creator. Redux Toolkit organizes folders by type.

What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
- built in helper functions like createAction, createSlice, and configureStore make redux easier to set up and manage.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

redux toolkit slices
- A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. [redux-toolkit.js](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice)

namespace
- A namespace in computer science (sometimes also called a name scope), is an abstract container or environment created to hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols (i.e. names). An identifier defined in a namespace is associated only with that namespace. The same identifier can be independently defined in multiple namespaces. That is, an identifier defined in one namespace may or may not have the same meaning as the same identifier defined in another namespace. Languages that support namespaces specify the rules that determine to which namespace an identifier (not its definition) belongs.[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace)
