>"Node.JS is an event-based, non-blocking, asyncronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 javascript engine and libuv library.

The V8 engine is the opensource JS engine that runs in google chrome responsible for compiling JS directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

NodeJS is a program we can use to execute JS on our computers.

NodeJS has excellent support for modern javascript, meaning you can write your JS using the latest and most current syntax.

NPM is the javascript package manager which comes bundled with node. It is the worlds largest software registry! You can install packages with npm:
- `npm init` sets up your package JSON file
- `npm install packageName` (`--save`) to install the package

Node is used to install and run various build tools designed to automate the process of developing a JS application. If you want to start developing apps with any modern JS framework you have to have a working knowledge of node and npm.

Node lets us run javascript on the server. It is a popular choice because of the NodeJS execution model. Being a single threaded event-driven runtime Node uses callbacks to ensure fast and efficient execution of code. Long processing code (async tasks) can be pushed off the stack and given a callback to run after the stack has been cleared. It is moved to a queue to wait for the event loop to call it when the stack is clear, this process repeats until there is nothing on the stack or in the queue. Javascript is so cool.

Node is particularly suited for apps that require some sort of real time interaction or collaboration.

Some advantages to using node are speed, scalability, and front and backend speaking the same language, also the ease in handling JSON data.
