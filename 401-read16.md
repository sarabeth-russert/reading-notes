## Code 401
#### Day 16


**Event Driven Applications**
Why is access control important?
- To ensure only people who are trusted users are able to change or delete content

Describe an application that would need access control.
- Pretty much any type of website from Banking Apps to Blogs

What is a role used for?
- To help standardize, assign, and define access levels

Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
- It is a simple system where access is based off of one factor, a role (which has access levels assigned), that is assigned to a user. In contrast mandatory access control tends to have multiple factors that contribute to a users access ability, and discretionary allows users to set their own access levels for the material they create which is less consistant and requires constant updating.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

Authorization
- gives a user permission to access a resource.

Role Based Access Control
- Access control based on the 'role' assigned to a user. These roles define what capabilities a user will have.
