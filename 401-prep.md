[How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

When programmers get problems to solve in an interview the most common mistakes they make are
- improper allocation of time
- not spending enough time understanding the problem
- trying to oversolve on the first attempt

These simple steps are recommended for solving an interview problem
1. Read the problem completely twice
2. Solve the problem manually w/ three sets of sample data
3. Optimize the manual steps
4. Write out the manual steps as comments or pseudo code
5. Replace the comments with real code
6. Optimize the code

>“Pretend your time is worth $1,000/hr. Would you spend five of them doing extra work for free? Would you waste one on being angry?” -Niklas Göke

Busyiness and stress are the enemy. Avoid being busy and instead carefully choose important things to focus on; cultivate extreme focus with whatever you do. Say no to things that don't warrent your time and focus.
If you value your time other people will recognize the value of your time as well.

>“Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.
Problem-solving skills are almost unanimously the most important qualification that employers look for….more than programming languages proficiency, debugging, and system design.
Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report)

Problem Solving is the Meta-Skill

Steps to problem solve
1. Understand
  - Be able to explain the problem in simple terms
2. Plan
  - Write out psudo-code or comment steps
3. Divide
  - Break large problems into smaller components
4. If you get Stuck
  - debug
  - reassess
  - research

Practice problem solving in your daily life
- Games, crafts, cooking, etc.
- Do code challenges [Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com/)

[5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

Get to the root of a problem quickly. Developed by Sakichi Toyoda

How to use the 5 whys
1. Assemble a team familiar with the problem
2. Define the problem
3. Start asking why... approximately 5 times*
4. Come up with a counter measure to answer the last why
5. Monitor measures and repeat the process if they stop working

*Stop asking why when the responses are no longer useful
