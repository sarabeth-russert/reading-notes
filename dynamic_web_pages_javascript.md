**Dynamic Web Pages with Javascript**

*Javascript* can be used to make html elements interactive. When used in front end development it brings a webpage to life. It can take input, return values, and animate elements. 

When a browser encounters `<script>` in the html document it will stop and load the script before moving on. We keep javascript in it's own file, the specific javascript code will not appear when a user tries to view the source of the webpage, it will just show the script link. 

>`<script src="fileName.js"></script>`

**Basic Javascript Instructions**

JS is written using a series of statements, which should always be closed by a semi-colon. Each statement is an individual instruction for the computer and should start on a new line. Blocks of code are surrounded by curly braces.

**Comment Out Code** It is important to keep good comments with javascript so that you will remember how and why you did something and to assist others in reading your code. Use `//` to comment out text.

**Variables** A bucket used to hold a value, specific to scope. You can *declare* a variable by giving it a name, and you can also assign a value. Declare variables using
- var - although I was taught not to use var
- let - this was the prefered term I was taught
- const - for global constants

We use = as the assignment opperator, it is not the same as 'equals'. Javascript is not a *type* language. It is very permissive so a variable can be declared without a type and can change types with reassignment. Variables can be
- numeric
- strings
- boolean
- arrays
- objects
- undefined
- null
