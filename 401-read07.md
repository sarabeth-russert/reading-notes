What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
- The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_verb)

Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js

Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
- Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture style for building scalable web services. REST services typically communicate via HTTP and are built using XML and JSON.

Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information to implement web services. It uses XML Information Set for message format and other application-layer protocols, such as HTTP or SMTP for message transmission.

REST is far more common of the two types of service, as it is more flexible (permitting more data formats, while SOAP only allows for XML) and uses standard HTTP. RESTful reads can also be cached, while SOAP reads cannot. [varnish-software](https://www.varnish-software.com/glossary/what-is-rest-and-what-is-soap/)
