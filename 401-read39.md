**Redux - Additional Topics**

What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?
- Seems like useEffect

When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?
- the function that the thunk is attached to

Document the following Vocabulary Terms

middleware
- Enhancers are powerful because they can override or replace any of the store's methods: dispatch, getState, and subscribe. But, much of the time, we only need to customize how dispatch behaves. It would be nice if there was a way to add some customized behavior when dispatch runs.
Redux uses a special kind of addon called middleware to let us customize the dispatch function.
If you've ever used a library like Express or Koa, you might already be familiar with the idea of adding middleware to customize behavior. In these frameworks, middleware is some code you can put between the framework receiving a request, and the framework generating a response. For example, Express or Koa middleware may add CORS headers, logging, compression, and more. The best feature of middleware is that it's composable in a chain. You can use multiple independent third-party middleware in a single project.
Redux middleware solves different problems than Express or Koa middleware, but in a conceptually similar way. Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more. [redux.js.org](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store)

thunk
- Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. The inner function receives the store methods dispatch and getState as parameters.
