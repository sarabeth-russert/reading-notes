**Custom Hooks**
What does a component’s lifecycle refer to?
- Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_lifecycle.asp)

Why do you sometimes need to “wrap” functions in useCallback when called from within useEffect
- Using useCallback should be preferred in the following cases

If you are passing the function on to child component as props and the child component doesn't often need re-rendering except when a certain prop change then useCallback might prevent certain re-renders. However if you state is complex and you need multiple such functions to be passed on to children as props, it better to shift to useReducer instead of useState and pass on the dispatch method to child components

You are specifying a function as a dependency to useEffect. In such as case you must ensure that the function in not recreated on every render or the useEffect will be triggered on every render.

Overall a decision to use useCallback must be made judiciously instead of blindly since you might just overdo the advantage offered by useCallback and end up degrading the performance since useCallback will also memoize the functions and a frequently changing dependency might anyways need to recreate the function.

Why are functional components preferred over class components?
- well if you ask jacob it is because they are new and have slightly better performance... I prefer them because with hooks I can avoid figuring out where to call a method that I need to affect my return value before it renders.

What is wrong with the following code?
- the first thing I see is that react won't let you render an object (renderedItems) to a page.
- we are taking in props, but not using them, not the end of the world
-

import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

`function MyComponent(props) {`
`  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`

`  function changeCount(e) {`
`    setCount(e.target.value);`
`  }`

`  let renderedItems = []`

`  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {`
`    useEffect( () => {`
`      console.log('component mount/update');`
`    }, [count]);`

`    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);`
`  }`

`  return (<div>`
`     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>`
`      {renderedItems}`
`    </div>);`
`}`


Document the following Vocabulary Terms

state hook
- A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. [ReactJS.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)

effect hook
- The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components [ReactJS.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)

reducer hook
- An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. (If you’re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.)

useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.
