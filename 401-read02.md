Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
- To use things that are not available from within a browser environment, like some apis. 
What is the difference between a module and a package?
- a module is a script, or collections of scripts or librarys... a package is a collection files needed for a module.
What does the node package manager do?
- npm, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. A plethora of Node.js libraries and applications are published on npm, and many more are added every day. These applications can be searched for on http://npmjs.org/. Once you have a package you want to install, it can be installed with a single command-line command.

Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module
1. `module.exports = functionName;`
2. `module.exports.varableName = () => {};`
3. `module.exports = function () { `

  `this.name = 'GeeksforGeeks'; `

  `this.website = 'https://geeksforgeeks.org'; `

  `this.info = () => { `

    `console.log(Company name - ${this.name}); `

    `console.log(Website - ${this.website}); `

  `} `

`} `

Term
ecosystem
  - In the context of software analysis, the term software ecosystem is defined by Lungu as “a collection of software projects, which are developed and co-evolve in the same environment”. The environment can be organizational (a company), social (an open-source community), or technical (the Ruby ecosystem). [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_ecosystem#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20software,technical%20(the%20Ruby%20ecosystem).)

Node.js 
- JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. [nodejs.org](nodejs.org)

V8 Engine
- V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others.[v8.dev](https://v8.dev/)

module
- A module may contain a class or a library of functions for a specific purpose. A module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that. [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/modules-intro)

package
- A package contains all the files needed for a module and modules are the JavaScript libraries that can be included in Node project according to the requirement of the project. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-npm-node-package-manager/)

server
- a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client–server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing))

environment
- A software development environment (SDE) is the collection of hardware and software tools a system developer uses to build software systems. When you are developing software, you probably don't want your users to see every messy part of your application creation process. [codebots.com](https://codebots.com/app-development/what-are-environments-in-software-development-a-guide-to-the-development-beta-and-production-environments#:~:text=A%20software%20development%20environment%20(SDE,of%20your%20application%20creation%20process.)

interpreter
- An Interpreter directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without previously converting them to an object code or machine code. Examples of interpreted languages are Perl, Python and Matlab. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-vs-interpreter-2/)

compiler
- takes entire program and converts it into object code which is typically stored in a file. The object code is also refereed as binary code and can be directly executed by the machine after linking. Examples of compiled programming languages are C and C++. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-vs-interpreter-2/)
